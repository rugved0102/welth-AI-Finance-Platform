📁 (auth) — Route Group
Purpose: Group all auth-related pages (like sign-in and sign-up)

NOT included in the URL (invisible)

Helps you:

Organize code

Apply a custom layout ((auth)/layout.js) for all auth pages

💡 You could also have (dashboard) or (marketing) route groups!

📁 sign-up — URL Segment
This creates the route:
✅ /sign-up

So when a user visits /sign-up, this folder's contents are matched.

📁 [[...sign-up]] — Optional Catch-All Segment
Why not just use page.jsx directly inside sign-up?
Because Clerk sometimes appends path segments to /sign-up (like OAuth, email verification, or SSO callback).

It enables support for:
URL	Match?
/sign-up	✅
/sign-up/sso-callback	✅
/sign-up/email-verify/abc123	✅

Without [[...sign-up]], these would cause 404 errors!

So Clerk recommends this catch-all format to ensure smooth handling of all routes.

You're using [[...sign-up]] inside (auth)/sign-up/ to safely support any path Clerk needs during sign-up, all while keeping your routes organized and robust.
